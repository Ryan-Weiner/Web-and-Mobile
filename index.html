                <p>
                    I am from a small town in Massachusetts called Northborough.  It is about a 45 minute drive west of Boston and 15 minute drive east of Worcester.  The population of the town is around 15,000 people and it is a suburban town.

                    Hobbies and Interests:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I have a very diverse range of hobbies that includes but is not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strongman</li>
                    <li>Armlifting</li>
                    <li>Building and modifying cars</li>
                    <li>Racing cars</li>
                    <li>Racquetball</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Welding</li>
                    <li>Skydiving</li>
                    <li>ETC...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, many of these hobbies are very expensive so I am unable to participate in all of them as frequently as I would like to. However, this does not stop my from spending much more than I should on them.

                    Currently Enrolled Classes:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled in 7 total classes.  The way my schedule works out, I have 3 classes every day and then use the rest of the time to work on homework and projects that will be due in the near future.  Luckily, I only have 2 8am classes every week which is Web and Mobile I every Tuesday and Thursday morning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My classes this semester are as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microeconomics</li>
                    <li>Project Based Calculus II</li>
                    <li>Computer Science for Transfer Students</li>
                    <li>Web & Mobile I</li>
                    <li>Introduction to Cybersecurity</li>
                    <li>Computing Explorartion Seminar</li>
                    <li>RIT 365: RIT Connections</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I consider myself lucky that I did not end up with any writing courses this semester, even though I know I will need to take them in the future.
